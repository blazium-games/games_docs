# Getting started

This page is a placeholder for getting-started content. Use it to validate that the docs site builds and that the sidebar links work.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- (Optional) Node.js 20+ for local development

## Validation

To build the site locally:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

To preview the built site:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then open the URL shown (with base path `/games_docs/`) in your browser.
